      Along with fabrication of guitars & basses, repair and restoration are a huge part of what goes on at Humco. Guitars, banjos, mandolins, ukeleles, bouzoukis, dulcimers, violins, autoharps have all made their way into the shop, and have all left to go on to irritate and entertain all roommates & loved ones, guaranteed.
